{"prompt": "Generate a multiple-choice question based on the following:\nQuestion: What is the primary mechanism by which the cardiac muscle cell generates force during contraction?\nA) nan\nB) nan\nC) nan\nAnswer:", "completion": " C) Increasing contractility with constant preload and afterload. The action potential of muscle cells depolarizes their T systems, tubular extensions of the cell membrane that transverse the cell in close approximation to the muscle fibrils, via L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. This initial increase in intracellular Ca2+ triggers an even greater Ca2+ influx across ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2). The force of contraction is directly dependent on the magnitude of the initial Ca2+ influx. During relaxation, when the L-type channels close, a Ca2+\u2013Mg2+-ATPase actively transports Ca2+ back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, relaxation of the heart also requires ATP. Ca2+ is also extruded extracellularly by an exchange of intracellular Ca2+ for extracellular sodium in a 1:3 ratio by the Na+\u2013Ca2+ exchanger in the cell membrane (Figure 20\u20132)."}
